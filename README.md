## Dependencies that I can think of
- vulkan sdk (kinda, only really needed so you can compile shaders and get validation layers)
- glfw (Add it to lib/)
- cmake (a recent version)
- A C compiler (gcc or clang)
- anything in lib/

To compile shaders, go into build.bat and change the path to be the path where you downloaded your vulkan sdk to
