# Three Hits
A game I made in 2021 in roughly 2 to 3 months over the summer.

The premise is that you can only survive three hits hence... 'Three Hits'

The main game can be found in [src/](src/) and was built with C, and the level compactor can be found in [level_compactor/](level_compactor/) and was built with C++.
